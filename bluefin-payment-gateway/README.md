# Bluefin Payment Gateway Plugin for WooCommerce

This is the official eCommerce plugin for accepting and processing payments via the Bluefin Payment Gateway for the WooCommerce platform/stores.

These are the Card-Not-Present transaction types that this WooCommerce plugin supports:

| Sale | Authorization + Manual Capture | Refund | Partial Refund | Void (Authorization Reversal) |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------ | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ✔    | ✔                              | ✔      | ✔              | ✗                             |



> 📘 Authorization + Manual Capture
>
> One of the most common use cases of **Authorization + Manual Capture** is when an order requires shipping (shipping-related information including address, etc). Upon the order having been shipped to the customer, the merchant manually captures the authorization - completing the order.
>
> In the case of Bluefin authorization transaction, note that the status of the WooCommerce order is `On hold`. Upon capture, it is `Completed`.
>
> For the tutorial of authorization and capturing a WooCommerce order via the Bluefin Plugin, see below.

Over the course of transaction actions, the order notes are updated according to the Bluefin Plugin for WooCommerce tracking purposes. For example,

To get these transaction actions from the Bluefin API, use the corresponding transaction id attached to the order and get the transaction metadata.
